# AIML_Internship

---------------  WEEK 1  ---------------                                      
We learn about the Concept of Deep Learning, what is Deep Learning, Types of Deep Learning, The Concept will be used, and the Project Pipeline.  

--------------- WEEK 2 ------------------                                       
In this Colab notebook, we learned how to use Python for detecting forest fires using machine learning. We explored how to load and analyze data, clean it for better results, and apply machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to make predictions. We also learned how to split data into training and testing sets, evaluate model accuracy, and understand the importance of features in predictions. This helped us understand the step-by-step process of building a real-world AI solution using Python.
