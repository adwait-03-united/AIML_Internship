# AIML_Internship

---------------  WEEK 1  ---------------                                      
We learn about the Concept of Deep Learning, what is Deep Learning, Types of Deep Learning, The Concept will be used, and the Project Pipeline.  

--------------- WEEK 2 ------------------                                       
In this Colab notebook, we learned how to use Python for detecting forest fires using machine learning. We explored how to load and analyze data, clean it for better results, and apply machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to make predictions. We also learned how to split data into training and testing sets, evaluate model accuracy, and understand the importance of features in predictions. This helped us understand the step-by-step process of building a real-world AI solution using Python.

-------------- WEEK 3 -------------------
In this Week 3 project, we built a deep learning model to detect forest fires from images. We started by downloading a wildfire image dataset and organizing it into training, validation, and test sets. We used TensorFlow and Keras libraries to process the images, apply data augmentation, and build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained to classify whether an image contains fire or not. We used GPU support to speed up training and evaluated the model's accuracy using test data. Finally, we visualized the training process with accuracy and loss graphs to understand how well the model performed.
